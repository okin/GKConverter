GKConverter
===========
This library gives the functionality to convert points from Gauss-Kr√ºger coordinate system into a latitude / longitude value (like GPS uses it).

The code was extracted from Florian Wetzels JavaScript converter that can be found at http://calc.gknavigation.de/ - kudos for it!

This is a port of https://github.com/okin/GKtoLatLong to Python.
